Using branches is a powerful and safe way for a team of software engineers to develop a project together, because each developer can work on designing new features or work on fixing bugs without affecting the main codebase. Essentially, every developer can freely experiment with the code without it affecting the current version of the project. Some of the problems that branches can help prevent are inadvertently overwriting another developer's code, or introducing incorrect code that does not work to the project.
